PROJECT TITLE: Connect 4
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Design an agent which can play connect4
VERSION or DATE: 18 Sept 2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Yue Zhuo
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

This project is focusing on training a agent that can play Connect 4, a two-player chess game. 
The game is played on a vertical grid with six rows and seven columns. The
players take turns placing pieces of their color, called ‘tokens’, into the board. The goal
of each player is to get four of his or her tokens in a row in the board, either
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

'My Agent' class was implemented by building a strategy to determine which column to play. 
It can beat build-in agent 9 times out of 10. 
All other codes were provided by Udacity
